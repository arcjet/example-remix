# Arcjet Remix example app

[Arcjet](https://arcjet.com) helps developers protect their apps in just a few
lines of code. Bot detection. Rate limiting. Email validation. Attack
protection. Data redaction. A developer-first approach to security.

This is an example Remix application demonstrating the use of multiple features.
There is a version deployed at
[https://example.arcjet.com](https://example.arcjet.com).

## Features

- [Signup form protection](https://example.arcjet.com/signup) uses Arcjet's
  server-side email verification configured to block disposable providers and
  ensure that the domain has a valid MX record. It also includes rate limiting
  and bot protection to prevent automated abuse.
- [Bot protection](https://example.arcjet.com/bots) shows how a page can be
  protected from automated clients.
- [Rate limiting](https://example.arcjet.com/rate-limiting) shows the use of
  different rate limit configurations depending on the authenticated user. A
  logged-in user can make more requests than an anonymous user.
- [Attack protection](https://example.arcjet.com/attack) demonstrates Arcjet
  Shield, which detects suspicious behavior, such as SQL injection and
  cross-site scripting attacks.
- [Sensitive info](https://example.arcjet.com/sensitive-info) protects against
  clients sending you sensitive information such as PII that you do not wish to
  handle.

## Run locally

1. [Register for a free Arcjet account](https://app.arcjet.com).

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Arcjet key. If you want to test
   the rate limiting authentication, you will also need to add a GitHub app key
   and secret after [creating a GitHub OAuth
   app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Deploy

If you use this for production, edit the `app/sessions.server.ts` file to
include your domain.
